# React Free State

Single-tree, type safe state management for React without the bloat.

## Introduction

For React there are many ways of managing the state of your application. Since
hooks have become popular a common pattern is to default to using a `useState`
hook.

For those familiar with redux, freedux also uses a single immutable object tree
to store the state of your application. But unlike redux, the Api requires
minimum boiler plate code, freeing you from the bloat of reducers, actions,
context, and dealing with immutability.
